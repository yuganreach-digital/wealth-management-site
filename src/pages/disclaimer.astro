      <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        All design projects involve various considerations and potential challenges.

        <li>• Budget considerations: Costs may vary based on material selections, market conditions, and project scope changes</li>
        <li>• Design subjectivity: Aesthetic preferences are personal and may evolve during the design process</li>
        <li>• Material availability: Selected materials may become unavailable or require substitutions</li>
