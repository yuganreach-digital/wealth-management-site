## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

### **CSS Not Loading (Skeleton Site)**
If you see a skeleton site with no styling:
1. **Check the build**: Make sure `pnpm build` completes without errors
2. **Check CSS files**: Look in `dist/_astro/` folder for CSS files
3. **Check HTML**: Verify CSS links are in the HTML
4. **Clear cache**: Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### **Common Issues:**
- **Base path errors**: Make sure `astro.config.mjs` doesn't have a `base` path for Netlify
- **Build failures**: Check Node.js version (use 18+)
- **Missing files**: Ensure all assets are in the `dist` folder
